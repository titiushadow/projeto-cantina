> This project was assigned by my professor in the classroom. We had to develop a Canteen Management System,
where students can indicate whether they will have a meal on a specific day, simplifying the control of the food service in the institution.

##  Student 👨‍🎓
<blockquote>
  The student can see the day's menu registered by the administrator and vote on whether they will eat or not. 
  If they choose to eat, it will appear on the administrator's screen that they are planning to eat that day.
</blockquote>

##  Administrator 🖥️
<blockquote>
  The administrator has full control; they can register students, list, edit, and delete student records. 
  They can perform the same actions for registered meals. Additionally, the administrator can read suggestions sent by students, which are submitted anonymously.
